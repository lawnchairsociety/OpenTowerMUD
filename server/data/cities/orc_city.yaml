    name: "The War Camp"
    description: "The heart of Skullgar, a sprawling encampment of hide tents and crude wooden structures built on blood-soaked ground. Massive bonfires burn day and night, and the air reeks of smoke, sweat, and old blood. A shimmering portal crackles near the largest fire, its surface dark and turbulent. A crude mailbox made from a hollowed skull stands nearby."
    description_day: "Warriors spar and boast while drums pound an endless rhythm. The strong survive here, the weak serve."
    description_night: "The fires burn brighter, and war chants echo across the camp. This is when the orcs truly come alive."
