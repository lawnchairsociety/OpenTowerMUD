  greeting: |
    %s smiles warmly as you approach.

    "Ah, %s! Welcome to our fair city. I'm here to help newcomers survive
    the Endless Tower. What would you like to know about?"

      talk %s tower    - The Endless Tower and what awaits you
      talk %s combat   - How to fight and stay alive
      talk %s save     - How your progress is saved
      talk %s shop     - Buying, selling, and equipment

    He leans on his walking stick. "Just ask about any topic, friend!"

  tower: |
    %s points toward the massive tower looming to the south.

    "That's the Arcane Spire - it's why we're all here." He squints upward,
    shielding his eyes. "Many adventurers have tried to reach the top. Few have
    succeeded. A powerful guardian awaits those who dare climb to the summit."

      - Go SOUTH four times from Town Square to reach the TOWER ENTRANCE
      - Type 'up' to begin climbing
      - Each floor has corridors, chambers, and treasure rooms
      - Every 10th floor has a powerful BOSS guarding the way forward!
      - The higher you climb, the stronger the monsters... and better the loot!

    "Start on floor 1, get some experience, then work your way up!"

    %s's expression grows serious.

    "The tower is dangerous. Here's how to not die... too often:"

      BEFORE FIGHTING:

      - Type 'wake' to stand back up
      - Or return to the temple and 'pray' for instant full heal

    "Always check your health before going deeper!"

  save: |
    %s nods reassuringly.

    "Ah, worried about losing your progress? Fear not!"

      Your progress is saved automatically:
      - When you disconnect or quit the game
      - When the server shuts down for maintenance
      - After important events like learning a new class

      You don't need to do anything special - just play and enjoy!

    "The magic of this realm remembers all your deeds, friend."

    %s jingles a few coins in his pocket.

    "Once you've explored the tower, travel becomes much easier!"

      - When you find a stairway, you 'discover' that floor's portal
      - Type 'portal' to see floors you've discovered
      - Type 'portal <floor>' to instantly travel there!

      - Town Square (floor 0) is always available
      - Great for quick trips back to heal, shop, and save!

    "Discover portals as you climb - they're lifesavers!"

  quests: |
    %s strokes his beard thoughtfully.

    "Quests! Yes, many folk in the city need help with tasks. Complete their
    quests and you'll be rewarded handsomely!"

    mage: |
